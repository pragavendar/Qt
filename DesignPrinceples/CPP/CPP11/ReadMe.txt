For your interest, hereâ€™s a list of the major features that C++11 adds. Note that this list is not comprehensive, but rather intended to highlight some of the key features of interest.

    auto (S.4.8 -- The auto keyword)
    char16_t and char32_t and new literals to support them (no tutorial yet)
    constexpr (4.13 -- Const, constexpr, and symbolic constants)
    decltype (no tutorial yet)
    default specifier (no tutorial yet)
    Delegating constructors (8.6 -- Overlapping and delegating constructors)
    delete specifier (9.13 -- Converting constructors, explicit, and delete)
    Enum classes (S.4.5a -- Enum classes)
    Extern templates (no tutorial yet)
    Lambda expressions (no tutorial yet)
    long long int (4.3 -- Object sizes and the sizeof operator)
    Move constructor and assignment (15.3 -- Move constructors and move assignment)
    Noexcept specifier (quick mention in 14.4 -- Uncaught exceptions, catch-all handlers, and exception specifiers)
    nullptr (6.7a -- Null pointers)
    override and final specifiers(12.2a -- The override and final specifiers, and covariant return types)
    Range-based for statements (6.12a -- For-each loops)

    static_assert (7.12a -- Assert and static_assert)
    std::initializer_list (10.7 -- std::initializer_list)
    Trailing return type syntax (S.4.8 -- The auto keyword)
    Type aliases (S.4.6 -- Typedefs and type aliases)
    typedef can now typedef template classes
    Uniform initialization (4.1 -- Introduction to fundamental data types)
    User-defined literals (no tutorial yet)
    Variadic templates (no tutorial yet)
    >> will now properly be interpreted as closing a template object

There are also many new classes in the C++ standard library available for use.

    Better support for multi-threading and thread-local storage (no tutorial yet)
    Hash tables (no tutorial yet)
